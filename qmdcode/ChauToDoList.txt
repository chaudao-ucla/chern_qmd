**TO-DO LIST** 


August 16 - August 26 
_____________________

[x] Add scaling function in "tbmd.cpp" that instantaneously expands the
	system box length and particle position. Will be used later for testing
	of quench dynamics. 

[x] Fix the issue of boxlength being miscalculated from density in local version 
	of code.

[x] Create ~5 configuration files using the equilibrium dynamics simulation. 
		Densities of: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5
		Time step: 0.01
		NStep: 10000
		N_Particles: 300
		Langevin Dynamics: yes
		kT: 0.001

[x] Modify data collection to sample and store g(r) at various timesteps instead 
	of just saving the most recent time. 

[ ] Using randomized initial conditions, see how g(r) changes for a system with 
	rho changing as a function of time. 


August 27 - September 3
_______________________

(below are some items I suggest, partly for benchmark, partly to better understand 
	the dynamics of our systems)

[ ] Start from some initial configuration, and run the energy-conserving dynamics 
	simulation and see whether the system reaches steady-state.

	Questions: How should I best characterize the steady-state? Is this just the
		density matrix no longer changing as a function of time? 
	
	Questions: For "energy-conserving dynamics simulation," I am assuming this is 
		the simulation in which the density matrix is changing with time. Is
		this the correct assumption?

(note: the initial state is not necessarily a random state. It could also be a 
	simple-cubic, bcc, or fcc lattice).

[ ] If the system reaches a steady state, check whether this state is a thermal 
	equilibrium state, i.e. can be described by a temperature.

[ ] specifically, check whether the velocities of atom follow Maxwell distribution.

[ ] Compute the g(r) in the steady-state, and see if it agrees with the g(r) in some 
	thermal equilibrium state

[ ] How to characterize the electronic sub-system ?


—————————————— For quench study ——————————————

[ ] Run the quench simulation, check the various energies (E_electron, E_pair, E_kinetic) 
	vs time, and see whether the system reaches a steady state, and how long it takes 
	to reach steady state.

[ ] Compute and plot the time dependence of the (instantaneous) Bott index after quench.
